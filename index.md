## Tools for audio editing or manipulation

* [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) is a free audio editing tool that is relatively simple to use
* [Audition](https://www.adobe.com/au/products/audition.html) if you have access to the Adobe Creative Cloud, or just Audition, this is a great tool to use. It allows for easy batch processing and creating preset tasks
* [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) though this is mostly known as a video processing tool, you can extract audio from video as well as manipulate your audio tracks (resample, mono -> stereo, boost volume, etc.) You can run across a full directory of files, or just one file at a time
* [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/) this is also mosly known as a video player, but you can easily extract audio from video using VLC
